A simple CLI tool to download YouTube videos in good quailty compared to those other shitty sites you find on google

Like bro??? Who maintains those sites they give me videos at 480p even though I click on 1080p ugh. Like bruh why you be making me code shit during my exam season but anyways...





## Running

To deploy this project you need to have deno installed and runn

```bash
  deno run --allow-all main.ts
```

That's it, it's gonna then ask you for the youtube link so give it the link and download your video. 
## Roadmap

- Idk make it look nice??

- Add more features

- Bundle it to 1 executable
